## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

I became more familiar with ReactJs by working on this project. this project gave me a better understanding of state and the different ways to bypass React's one direction data flow. Using redux allowed me to create a store that the components could later pull from, and where state changes where reflected throughout.

### Continued development

Going forward I wold like to increase my use of Redux stores for state management and find different CSS libraries that can speed up design.

### Useful resources

- [React Redux (with Hooks) Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jULHSe41ls) - This helped me understand the basics of Redux.
